# EDA_Netflix_Data
"This project is focused on Netflix, an OTT company that provides online movies and TV shows. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I aimed to help the organization understand their reach on the movies and shows they offer and customize their content accordingly. I used Python as the main tool for this project."

I have performed this EDA in Jupyter Notebook using Python. Then I converted the notebook into pdf and uploaded here with the name "Netflix.pdf".
