# EDA_Netflix_Data
"This dataset contains data for more than 9.5K cars sale in Ukraine. Most of them are used cars so it opens the possibility to analyze features related to car operation. This is a subset of all car data in Ukraine. Using this We will analyze the various parameters of used car sales in Ukraine."

I have performed this EDA in Jupyter Notebook using Python. Then I converted the notebook into pdf and uploaded here with the name "Netflix.pdf".
